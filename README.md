# Brain-Tumor-detection-miniproject-3-2
The brain tumors, are the most common and aggressive disease, leading to a very short life expectancy in their highest grade. Thus, treatment planning is a key stage to improve the quality of life of patients. Generally, various image techniques such as Computed Tomography (CT), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and ultrasound image are used to evaluate the tumor in a brain. Especially, in this work MRI images are used to diagnose tumor in the brain.
 
The aim of the project is to develop a “Brain Tumor Detection Model” which detects the brain tumor from the given MRI Images using CNN.

 In this work, automatic brain tumor detection is proposed by using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) classification. The deeper architecture design is performed by using small kernels. The weight of the neuron is given as small. 

The objective of this project is to increase the accuracy, decrease the complexity.
 
Dataset Specifications: The Brain Tumor dataset is taken from Kaggle. It contains 98 files which does not contain tumor and 155 files which contains tumor. 

Percentage used for training is 80% and percentage used for testing is 20%.


The main goal of this research work is to design efficient automatic brain tumor detection with high accuracy, performance and low complexity. 

Further to improve the accuracy and to reduce the computation time, a convolution neural network-based classification is introduced in the proposed scheme. Also, the detection results are given as whether tumor is present or not in the given MRI image of the brain.

 CNN is one of the deep learning methods, which contains sequence of feed forward layers. Also, python language is used for implementation. Image net database is used for classification. It is one of the pre-trained models. So, the training is performed for only final layer. Also, raw pixel value with depth, width and height feature value are extracted from CNN. 

The training accuracy, validation accuracy and validation loss are calculated. The training accuracy is obtained by using CNN model. Similarly, the validation accuracy will be high and validation loss will be very low.
